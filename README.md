### raspberrypi-dht22
### Temperature/Humidity monitoring using Raspberry + DHT22 Sensor with programmable power control.

## ![Weather Metrics script](dht22.py)

Read Sensor metrics, output to stdout (CSV format) and optionally post them to ThingSpeak.<br/>
Logs to syslog but if there is an error it will also start logging to stderr.<br/>
Since this is intended to be called from cron if there are messages to stderr an e-mail alert will be generated.<br/>
That way if an e-mail alert is send (only upon errors) we will receive all logs send to stderr, including the final success status if any.

**Power Control**.<br/>
An additional GPIO port can be used to control the power of the sensor.<br/>
This is optional but it solves an occasional issue with this sensor. Sometimes the sensor returns Nan values until it is powered off and on again. Restarting Raspberry wonâ€™t help in this case since the 5V GPIO pin will remain on during the power cycle.

# ![Configuration file](dht22.yml)<br/>
Load options from the first yaml file found ```(dht22.yml, /usr/local/etc/dht22.yml)```.<br/>

## Installation
- Tested on Raspbian Buster version: February 2020, release date: 2020-02-13.
- Requires Python 3.6 or higher.

**Deploy with ![Ansible](ansible/) or follow the below steps.**

Install additional debian packages.
```sh
$ apt-get install python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-urllib3 python3-yaml python3-rpi.gpio
```

Install Adafruit-DHT.
```sh
$ pip3 install --user Adafruit-DHT
```

Copy script ```/usr/local/bin/dht22.py``` and config file  ```/usr/local/etc/dht22.yml```.

Create directory for csv files.
```sh
$ mkdir /var/local/dht22
```

Crontab entry that runs the script every 10 minutes and appends stdout to a monthly file:
```
*/10 * * * * : Weather_Metrics ; /usr/local/bin/dht22.py 1>>/var/local/dht22/$(/bin/date +\%Y\%m).csv
```

If Power control port is used:<br/>
Optionally add a cron job that will power on the sensor on boot.
```
@reboot /usr/bin/gpio -g mode <GPIO_Powerctl_Port> output && /usr/bin/gpio -g write <GPIO_Powerctl_Port> 1
```
Otherwise the script will power on the sensor upon first run but in this case expect a delay on the first run.
